# McAfee Web Gateway Cloud Services (WGCS) Logpuller Script

Script to get McAfee Web Gateway Cloud Service logs from McAfee SaaS-API. Logs are downloaded to ```'OutputLog.$NowUnixEpoch$.csv'``` and can be forwarded to a remote syslog host or SIEM when ```syslogEnable``` is set to ```'True'```.

> **Note:**
>
> When forwarding is used the downloaded CSV is transformed into a JSON stream. Configure your syslog/SIEM input correspondingly.

Timestamp is automatically adjusted with the last successful time of request. The corresponding configuration option ```requestTimestampFrom``` is updated after each run of the script.

The script is using McAfee SaaS Message API ver. 5
